# Arrays – Data Structures in C++

## 🌟 Overview
Arrays are fixed-size data structures that store elements of the same type in contiguous memory.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- `examples/`: Simple array syntax and usage
- `problems/`: Practice problems from basic to advanced
- `mini_project/`: Real-world project using arrays – Grade Analysis Tool

## 🛠️ Mini Project: Grade Analysis Tool
This CLI app:
- Takes student names & marks
- Computes average, pass/fail, min, max
- Classifies students by grade

## 🧠 How to Run

```bash
g++ grade_analysis_tool.cpp -o grade_tool
./grade_tool
# Data-Structures-Cpp
Practicing C++ Data Structures with examples, problems, and mini-projects.
